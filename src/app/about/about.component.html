  <p>Our journey began with one humble shop in Fort, Mumbai and grew to over one thousand locations throughout India
    under the inspiring vision of our founder, Hussein Khorakiwala in the early 1956. Since then, our family has
    combined their years of experience with the vision of a community of collaborative shop owners, suppliers and other
    partners
    working together to create a brand name in the market to grow their business to what it is today.

    In order to achieve this, the family offers franchises to budding entrepreneurs & distributors partnering with them
    to ensure
    success and excellence.

<h1 class="abt"><b><i>Our Secret</i></b></h1>
<p class="story">Monginis only uses the finest ingredients in its products,
  ensuring the goods that we send out into the market are of the utmost quality.
  Monginis believes in order to give the Real taste of any product, real ingredients should be used & not cheaper
  substitutes.
  Our production includes a highly-customized, automated system but does not forego the importance of the human touch,
